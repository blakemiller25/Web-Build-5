                            Model: Defines the data structure of the application and typically represents database tables. Django's Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system allows developers to interact with the database using Python code instead of SQL.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            View: Handles the presentation logic and user interface. Views are responsible for processing user requests, interacting with the model to retrieve data, and rendering the appropriate response.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Template: Defines the presentation of the data and controls how information is displayed. Django uses a template engine to dynamically generate HTML, allowing developers to separate the design from the application logic.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Controller (in MVT): While Django's MVT pattern doesn't explicitly have a separate controller, the framework's views serve a similar purpose by handling user input and directing the flow of data between the model and the template.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Django Admin: A powerful and customizable administrative interface generated automatically based on the models defined in the application. It provides an easy way to manage and interact with the data in the database.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            URL Routing: Django uses a URL dispatcher to route incoming requests to the appropriate view based on URL patterns defined in the application.
                        </li>
