                    Trees. It was something about the trees. The way they swayed with the wind in unison. 
                    The way they shaded the area around them. The sounds of their leaves in the wind and the creaks from the branches as they sway, 
                    The trees were making a statement that I just couldn't understand.

                    It was difficult to explain to them how the diagnosis of certain death had actually given him life.
                    While everyone around him was in tears and upset, he actually felt more at ease. The doctor said it would be less than a year. 
                    That gave him a year to live, something he'd failed to do with his daily drudgery of a routine that had passed as life until then.

                    "Explain to me again why I shouldn't cheat?" he asked. 
                    "All the others do and nobody ever gets punished for doing so. 
                    I should go about being happy losing to cheaters because I know that I don't? That's what you're telling me?"

                    All he wanted was a candy bar. It didn't seem like a difficult request to comprehend, 
                    but the clerk remained frozen and didn't seem to want to honor the request. 
                    It might have had something to do with the gun pointed at his face.

                    What was beyond the bend in the stream was unknown. 
                    Both were curious, but only one was brave enough to want to explore. 
                    That was the problem. There was always one that let fear rule her life.

                    It was difficult for him to admit he was wrong. He had been so certain that he was correct and the deeply held belief could never be shaken. 
                    Yet the proof that he had been incorrect stood right before his eyes. "See daddy, I told you that they are real!" his daughter excitedly proclaimed.
